00:00 - 03:05 main structure
the entire skin : aluminium sheet fixed by 리벳

the air frame - considered by the entire structure excepting the engine and aeroelectronical mechanics
green colour skeletons(sometimes yellow) comes from a primer of 크롬산 or 인산 아연.
It is applied for preventing from aluminum's 부식 in almost parts.
Older models might not have this layer of primer, and they would have an original aluminum and metalic look.

This particular aircraft has wings 지지대 to reinforce(or enforce to join between wings and fuselage. 
It attatches from a main spar to the lower front section of the fuselage. 
Because this aircraft has a high 윙 컴프레션 and head room space in this cockpit limited. 
The full main spars can not go through the cockpit, and instead there are couple of spars carry through channel to join the wings together.
Of course, these channels are not as strong as main spars. But that's wings 지지대 come into play to distribute the low of the forces. 
On the exterior off their 프랜,will see this static 윅ㅅ for static dischargers attatched to this sharpest point of the aircraft like the trailing edge of the wings. 
They discharge 엌커모레이티드 static 리퓰리시티 back to the surrounding air while in flight. 
Without them, thier static electricity built up at a 휴멀레이트 on other sharpest 이스트리미릿 like antenas causing 무선 간섭.
